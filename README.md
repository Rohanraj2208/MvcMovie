# MvcMovie

## In this project I have used asp.net core mvc and have created a page where we can add different movies and their details.
### The movie can be the movie we want to watch or have watched.

### We can provide different details about the movie such as the date of release of the movie, the price of tickets or the rating it was given. 

### The data is stored in a local SQL database with an initial migration. When we add new movie the database gets updated.

### Furthoremore we can edit details of the movie, delete a movie and search for movies.
